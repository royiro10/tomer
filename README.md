# Tomer - Node.js Logger Implementation for TypeScript

Tomer is my implementation of a logger utility in NodeJs.
it is fun to write and helps me better understand node internals.

## Every bug I face, I try to rember wha I glad I did this

- went over NodeJs streams API again and better understand it by playing with it.
- read a bit of NodeJs Source Code which was nice, (specifily /lib/interna/console, /lib/internal/stream)
- learn a little chunk about how termianl works and about escape code charcther and terminal manipulation
